Code from my undergraduate senior thesis at Middlebury College. Completed as part of the Coe Lab and published May 19, 2020.

I would like to thank Dr. Nico Gomez, Dr. David Allen (Middlebury College), and Niko Carvajal Janke for their contributions and assistance in writing these scripts. I would like to thank Dr. Kirsten Coe for her mentorship.

Thesis title: DESICCATION TOLERANCE OF SYNTRICHIA CANINERVIS ALONG A PRECIPITATION GRADIENT IN THE SHEEP CREEK MOUNTAINS, NEVADA
Data generated using a modified LI-COR 6800 system and Moss + Soil and just Soil samples post hydration events.

`C Bal Script for DF Creation.R` : Code for visualizing C balance curves and extracting unique values from CO2 flux curves of Moss + Soil and Soil samples.

`Composite Curve Script .R` : Code to make a Composite Curve of Cbals (code written in collaboration with Nico Gomez).

`Figures & Data Analysis Script.R` : Code to build all figures in my thesis (with the exception of the compositive curve which has a separate script, `Composite Curve Script .R`) and run statistical tests on the data generated.
